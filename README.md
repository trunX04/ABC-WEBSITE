# ABC-Website
This is my contribution for the website that was hosted by my club for the technical event  conducted during the Gravitas'22. This website displays problem statements, timelines, speakers' details, contact information, and other useful announcements for the participants of the hackathon.
<br> <br>The website is hosted [here](https://alphabiocell.in/GRAVITAS/index.html).
